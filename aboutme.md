# Quick Intro

Hey! My name is Benjamin von Snarski. I am a Master of Mechatronics Engineering from the University of Queensland and have plenty of stories to share, whether it be my personal projects or my overseas travel. In any case, here is a casual outline of my resume, and please don't hesitate to reach out for any questions!

# Education

I graduated from the University of Queensland in June of 2025 with a Bachelor and Master of Mechatronics Engineering. During my study, I was an executive member for the Mechatronics And Robotics Society (UQ MARS) and even went on an exchange semester program at the Technical University of Munich in Germany. I extended my stay in Germany to complete my Master's industry placement at Carl Zeiss AG for which I attained the Dean's Commendation for Academic Excellence.

# Experience

My first major work experience began at UQ when I joined the Neuro-Rehabilitation and Medical Robotics lab for an exoskeleton project. I was able to learn much about C++ and control design which proved crucial in performing well for the Master's placement in Germany. The placement (combined internship) focused on developing a Digital Twin of a medical robot stack that included technology such as the Robot Operating System (ROS2), Pixar's Universal Scene Description (USD) and Dear ImGui.
